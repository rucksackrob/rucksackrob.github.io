<p>For this narrative visualization, I have selected an interactive slide show to tell my story 
    about the apparent lack of association between college tuitions and certain factors that might 
    influence (or be influenced by) how much you spend. 
</p>
<p>In this visualization, each scene is represented by a slide. After the title slide, each slide 
    contains a single chart demonstrating the relationship between tuition and one or more factors. 
    I chose the interactive slide show to tell this story in a linear fashion, though one that would 
    allow the viewer to move back and forth as desired.
</p>
<p>For consistent visual style, each scene/slide is laid out similarly even if the charts themselves 
    are different. Every slide has a short blurb serving as an annotation describing what the data is 
    showing and letting the user know what interactive elements are present for them to explore the data 
    within the chart presented in the scene. The positioning of blurb and chart, header and buttons is the 
    same for every slide. Colors are consistent with the region variable on all three slides. Shapes for the 
    scatter plots show the same ownership information. Arrow buttons for moving forward or backward in the 
    slide show (and for viewing this essay) are in the same place from slide to slide. Additionally, though 
    there are two types of charts, they all share one common element for interactivity - the ability to mouse 
    over a data point or region and get more specific information via a tooltip. They also use similar font 
    sizes and axis elements (which are simple) to maintain this visual continuity.
    </p>
    <p>I will share a bit more about the important elements of this narrative visualization: scenes, annotations, parameters, and triggers:</p>
    <p><b>Scenes:</b></p>
    <p>Aside from the title slide, I have included three scenes, each presented as a separate slide. I have described
        the common visual elements of these scenes above. The three specific scenes, with some details about their layout/design are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The relationship between tuition and teacher salary:
            <p>This scene shows a scatter plot demonstrating the relationship, or lack thereof, between tuition and teacher salary. 
                Shapes and colors were used to provide extra information about each data point, namely the ownership type and region
                of each school represented in the chart. Because there are many datapoints, especially for each region, I allowed filtering
                by region by clicking on the region on the legend. I have made it possible for the viewer to see detailed data for each school
                by mousing over the data point. The blurb in the left-hand column describes what I believe the data shows to help tell the viewer 
                the story and provides some suggestions for interacting with the chart.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>The relationship between tuition and graduation rate:
            <p>This scene uses the same design/layout as the first scatter plot, but swaps out teacher salary for graduation rate. Design and layout
                elements are the same.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Average regional tuitions:
            <p>This scene employs a bar chart for more direct comparisons of average tuition based on region. Note that the colors of the bars
            are the same as for regions on the scatter plots, to provide some visual continuity for the user even though the chart type is different. 
            The blurb, buttons, tooltips, and axes were all selected to maintain visual continuity as I moved away from the scatter plots to this bar 
            chart. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Annotations</b></p>    
    <p>There are no permanently displayed annotations on the charts themselves. This was a deliberate choice and was done for a couple of reasons. 
        First, there was no striking trend to point out in these charts. Calling out specific data points on the scatter plot, especially, seemed 
        arbitrary. As such, I decided to include the blurb column on each chart as a callout of what the whole chart is showing you. Second, and this 
        is also especially true for the scatter plots, there is enough going on just presenting the data so that cluttering it further didn't seem like 
        a good choice. Putting the annotation to the side of the chart just made sense. I could have added on-chart annotations for the bar chart more 
        easily, but visual continuity was important, so I kept the story-telling in the same place: in the blurb column on the left.
    </p>
    <p>I also hope that the story I'm telling in the blurbs inspires the viewer to explore the data some themselves and I essentially wanted all of
        the data points to have annotations, but certainly not on screen at all times. Tooltips served this function. The bar chart could have 
        maintained visual clarity while having these annotations on screen at all time, but I still preferred to maintain the visual simplicity and 
        consistency of not having that information on screen at all times and suggesting to the viewer that they should explore and reveal that information 
        on their own
    </p>
     <p><b>Parameters</b></p>   
     <p>There are several parameters that control the visualization:</p>
     <ul>
         <li>Slide number/scene number: Moving between slides affected many parameters and was itself affected by user input using the left and right 
             buttons.</li>
         <li>Blurb text and slide title: changed based on which scene/slide was being shown.</li>
         <li>Chart shown: which chart was shown was based on which scene/slide was being shown.</li>
         <li>Data variables: which data variables were selected depended on which scene/slide was being shown.</li>
         <li>Regional data subsets: for the two scatter plots, how much of the data, filtered by region, was based on user selection.</li>
         <li>Tooltips and datapoint details: which tooltip (and therefore the datapoint for which detailed data was displayed) was dependent on user 
             input as well. Note a couple specific parameters regarding the tooltip: the color of the tooltip matches the datapoint being selected and 
             the size of the tooltip automatically fits the text. </li>
         <li>Region: as per the above point, region can affect color of a tooltip when read from a selected datapoint or affect which data points are 
             visible when selected from the legend.</li>
         <li>Opacity: opacity of legend items, tooltips, bars in the bar chart, were all affected by user interaction.</li>
         <li>Mouse position, mouse activity: These get at some of the key triggers of the visualization, but they are parameters as well - ones 
             determined by user input. Where the mouse is positioned determines some display elements. Whether it has been clicked influences 
             what is shown. These are parameters regarding the state of the visualization and must be captured to trigger important events.</li>
     </ul>
    <p><b>Triggers</b></p>
    <p>There are several triggers based on parameter changes, mostly influenced by a user action. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking the previous or next buttons (the green arrow buttons): changes the slide/scene forward or backward.</li>
        <li>Clicking the "About the visualization" button: opens this essay in a new window or tab.</li>
        <li>Changing the slide/scene: changes the chart type, blurb text and slide title, can change available navigation buttons at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Changing the chart type: changes what data is displayed and some of the available chart interactions.</li>
        <li>Clicking a region on the legend: filters out other regions from the scatter plot being shown.</li>
        <li>Clicking the "Region" header on the legend: resets all the filters so all data points are shown on the scatter plot.</li>
        <li>Positioning the mouse over a navigation button at the bottom: triggers a color change for the button, giving a clue that it can be clicked.</li>
        <li>Positioning the mouse over a region (or the "Region" header) on the legend: displays a tooltip to guide the viewer that they can click 
            to change the filtering state.</li>
        <li>Positioning the mouse over a data point on the scatter plot: gives information specific to the school that the data point represents</li>
        <li>Positioning the mouse over a bar on the bar chart: gives detailed data for the region that the bar represents.
    </ul>
    <p><b>A closing note</b></p>
       <p>I chose some elements that helped to tell a very short story about the seeming lack of relationship between tuition and what you get for it. 
           If I kept telling this story, I would explore many more variables and find some more meaningful trends, and the story would change. 
           There are also many ways to tell this story visually and other charts could be used to tell these parts of the story; I feel like I only 
           scratched the surface in that regard.  This is more like the start of a story than the whole story, but I thought that the nature of the 
           assignment was to make a couple charts really do what I wanted them to do instead of make many charts and not have the time to really explore 
           what each chart could do. I hope that the viewers - fellow students, professors, and random passers-by - enjoy what I've put together. 
           Thanks for looking.
